# What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a spec that describes a declarative query language that our clients can use to ask an API for the exact data that they want. This is achieved by creating a strongly typed Schema for our API.

This gives us ultimate flexibility in how our API can resolve data, and client queries validated against our Schema.

##### GraphQL is just a spec. There are several implementations of GraphQL.
